<h3>👋 Hi, I'm Michael! (he/him)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who loves getting his hands dirty in any kind of code, but my biggest love is the front-end, and working directly with users. I have 
  experience scaling up enterprise UIs in React/TypeScript codebases, and am happy to talk your ear off about why TypeScript is both the greatest and worst thing in the world.

    Lately I've been using my programming skills to make games and interactive media. I'm also a fan of
    <a href="https://devon.lol/blog/the-old-web/">the non-commercial web</a> and want to do my part in making 
    the internet weird again. I have a lot of love and respect for communities like <a href="https://sadgrl.online/">Sadgrl.online</a> that aim
    to help bring back what used to make the 'net so special.
    If you're interested at all, <a href="https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto">their manifesto's</a> a really good place to start.
