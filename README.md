<h3>👋 Hi, I'm Michael! (he/they)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of professional experience and 10+ years of hobbyist experience. I'm always happy to get my hands dirty with any kind of computing, but my areas of expertise
  are UI programming, visual design, state modeling, and accessibility. I believe that all code should strive for (provable) correctness, and "wishful thinking programming" doesn't cut it for any
  production system.

<p>
  Previously I worked for <a href="https://coder.com/">Coder</a>, the industry leader in Cloud Development Environments (CDEs). There, I led the charge on a number of frontend initiatives, as well
  as a number of features for the core product infrastructure. My two biggest claims to fame are that I was the lead developer for Coder's SDK in Spotify's Backstage platform, and that I was co-lead
  for the re-launch of Coder's Registry platform, handling the backend services, the community repo for publishing new plugins, and the public catalog website. I was regarded as the TypeScript domain
  expert within the company, and provided a lot of consulting, dogfooding, and feedback for <a href="https://github.com/coder/guts">Coder's "Go Unto TypeScript" (GUTS) package</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I have written library code in React and TypeScript several times in my career, and can tell you all the tips and tricks for getting React's APIs and TypeScript's types to do what you want. At the same
  time, while TypeScript has the most powerful type system in the world, I firmly believe that unless you're writing library code, your types should follow Go's simplicity as much as possible. There is
  such a thing as being too clever.
</p>

<p>
  I believe in an accessible internet, and believe that it should be for everyone.
