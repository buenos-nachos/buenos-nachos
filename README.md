<h3>👋 Hi, I'm Michael! (he/they)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of professional experience and 10+ years of hobbyist experience. I'm always happy to get my hands dirty with any kind of computing, but my areas of expertise
  are:
  <ol>
    <li>✨UI programming</li>
    <li>⚛️ State modeling</li>
    <li>🧪 Software testing</li>
    <li>✨ Visual design</li>
    <li>♿️ Web accessibility and compliance/auditing</li>
  </ol>
  I believe that all code should strive for (provable) correctness, and "wishful thinking programming" doesn't cut it for any production system.

  Previously I worked for <a href="https://coder.com/">Coder</a>, the industry leader in Cloud Development Environments (CDEs). There, I led the charge on a number of frontend initiatives, as well
  as a number of features for the core product infrastructure. My two biggest claims to fame are:
  <ol>
    <li>🎸 I was the lead developer for Coder's SDK in Spotify's Backstage platform</li>
    <li>🤝 I was co-lead for the re-achitecture and re-launch of Coder's Registry platform, handling the backend services, the community repo for publishing new plugins, and the public catalog website.</li> 
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  I was regarded as the TypeScript domain expert within the company, and provided a lot of consulting, dogfooding, and feedback for <a href="https://github.com/coder/guts">Coder's "Go Unto TypeScript" (GUTS) package</a>.
</p>

<p>I also handled a lot of hiring and interviews, and designed the problems and guidelines for evaluating Coder's first-ever staff-level frontend position.</p>
