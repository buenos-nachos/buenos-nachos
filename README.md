<h3>👋 Hi, I'm Michael! (he/they)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of professional experience and 10+ years of hobbyist experience. I'm always happy to get my hands dirty with any kind of computing, but my areas of expertise
  are UI programming, visual design, state modeling, and accessibility. I believe that all code should strive for (provable) correctness, and "wishful thinking programming" doesn't cut it for any
  production system.
</p>

<p>
  I believe the internet should be for everyone, and that it's our job as developers to make it as accessible as possible.

<h4>🤠 Recent work</h4>
<p>
  Previously I worked for <a href="https://coder.com/">Coder</a>, the industry leader in Cloud Development Environments (CDEs). There, I led the charge on a number of frontend initiatives, as well
  as a number of features for the core product infrastructure. My two biggest claims to fame are:
  <ol>
    <li>🎸 I was the lead developer for Coder's SDK in Spotify's Backstage platform</li>
    <li>🤝 I was co-lead for the re-launch of Coder's Registry platform, handling the backend services, the community repo for publishing new plugins, and the public catalog website.</li> 
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  I was regarded as the TypeScript domain expert within the company, and provided a lot of consulting, dogfooding, and feedback for <a href="https://github.com/coder/guts">Coder's "Go Unto TypeScript" (GUTS) package</a>.
</p>

<p>I also handled a lot of hiring and interviews, and designed the problems and guidelines for evaluating Coder's first-ever staff-level frontend position.</p>
